# Codewars

Codewars is a great place to practice breaking down problems into solvable chunks and problem solving in pairs. It has challenges called katas with scenarios and puzzles that you'll solve by writing a function in JavaScript, and we'll use these throughout the course for [deliberate practice](https://jamesclear.com/beginners-guide-deliberate-practice) in problem solving and articulating.

Katas are ranked in difficulty, and the numbers work in reverse - level 8 (8 kyu) katas are the easiest, while level 1 (1 kyu) are the most difficult. For each kata you complete you get honor points toward levelling up your own rank, and you can also see your position on a leaderboard for some healthy competition - we'll have more about that soon!

You should always aim to:

- Break down problems
- Write a plan
- Practice articulating your thought process

This is great preparation for interviews! 

We have plenty of video examples in the School of Code library. You don't need to watch every video, just enough to understand the recommended technique. Feel free to search for or ask for examples.

Practicing this way will help you build the habit of systematic problem-solving.

👉 If you've not already done so, sign up to [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/join) using your Github account. You'll need to select JavaScript and solve your first kata before you can finish signing up.

## Challenges to have a go at first

👉 Work through this set of first katas that practice the JavaScript fundamentals we've gone through:

- [Opposite Number](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56dec885c54a926dcd001095/train/javascript)

## Bonus challenges to continue with

👉 Work through these katas as next steps:

- [If you can't sleep, just count sheep!!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b077ebdaf15be5c7f000077/train/javascript)
- [Grasshopper - Summation](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55d24f55d7dd296eb9000030/train/javascript)

## Keep going!

Explore Codewars and keep practicing. Most of the challenges are community generated, so not all of them are perfect. We'd advise that you sort by popularity and pick ones that are `8 kyu` to start with. When you've had enough of 8s, try your hand at some popular 7s. Happy coding!
